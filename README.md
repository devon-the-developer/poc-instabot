Proof of Concept - Instagram "Like" Bot and Manager

I will be using python3 and make a GUI for the user to be able to interact and choose settings 
Listed below will be information on how to use the program and a list of features that I wish to add.
Whilst I will try to make a maintainable code, this is intended to be a proof of concept so will be more about fast pace iterations. 


## MVP 

1. User should be able to login to account 
2. User should be able to select appropriate tags to be searched
3. Bot should select a user and like a photo
4. Bot should record all liked photos
5. Bot should limit itself to liking 3 different users photos per day


## Future Features

* Bot should suggest photos for commenting 
* User should be able to comment on suggested photos from GUI
* Bot should suggest tags to be targeted 
* User should be able to set maximum/minimum likes a day

## How To Setup & Use Software:

Coming Soon.
